TRIPLE REDIRECTION: 
echo sth | >>> asffdasdf.sdfasfd.asdf

◦ < should redirect input.
◦ > should redirect output.
◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
◦ >> should redirect output in append mode
